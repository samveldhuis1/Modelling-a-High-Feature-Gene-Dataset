### High Feature Gene Project 
 
### Overview 
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of biological data, specifically utilizing various machine learning techniques to understand and predict outcomes based on gene expression levels. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model fitting, and evaluation. 
The data consists of simulated genes with hypothetical expression values.

### Usage
The notebook is divided into sections, starting from data loading, followed by preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, and finally, model training and evaluation. Here's a brief overview of what each major section does: 
 
1. Data Loading: Load the training and test datasets. 
2. Data Preprocessing: Identify and handle missing data, detect and correct anomalies, and standardize the data. 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand the distribution, correlation among features, and other characteristics. 
4. Feature Selection and Engineering: Identify and select significant features for the model. 
5. Model Training: Train different models, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and others, using pipelines for efficient workflow. 
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as ROC AUC and apply techniques like cross-validation for robustness.
